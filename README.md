# SAAQD

Statistical Analysis of Air Quality Data. Done at Universit√© d'Angers for the purpose of a group project.

- The project calculates derivative data of 2 years from sensors located in various locations in Angers.
- The base code is code given to me when I started working on this project.
- There are already generated graphs for analysis in the graphs folder.

## To run code:

1. Download and run main code `gp1.ipynb`.
2. (Optional) Download precalculated Excel files and be able to skip gathering and computing of some of the data.
